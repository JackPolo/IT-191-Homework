Jobs After College

	The 3 jobs I would like after graduating from ISU are IT Service Technician, Network Technician, or IT Compliance Analyst. The way I will prepare for these jobs will be by learning as much as I can from my core classes here at ISU, learned all I can from my job at Endpoint Support, and by taking a good summer internship so that I can learn valuable IT workplace skills. In addition to that, I have an IT mentor who I can talk to about specific requirements and what they translate to in plain English. One big step I want to make to prepare myself for these jobs is to learn how to use Linux, Unix, and Mac OSX, as a knowledge of different operating systems (especially Linux and Unix) is a must for certain jobs. Understanding various services such as DNS, SMTP, SNMP, SSL, SSH, FTP and SFTP will also be a big help to diversify my knowledge of IT, so I will study that in my free time, learn what I can about them in class, and use them at work/internships when applicable.

	The 3 jobs I would like about 5-10 years down the line after graduating from college are Cyber Security Engineer, Network Solutions Architect, and Senior Security & Compliance Specialist. The last one is my primary goal as it is a Disney career. I plan on going to live near Orlando, Florida and I think it would be a pretty good company to get involved with. These jobs require years of experience so I definitely would have to wait to try and apply to them. In order to meet the requirements that these positions need, I would obviously work in IT after graduating, but I would also try to learn as much as I can wherever I work and also try to advance myself to higher positions as well. That way I’ll be tackling more responsibility and performing new job duties which will hopefully align with the requirements that Disney has. One thing I’m going to have to keep familiar with (though it pains me to say so) is programming languages, like java, python, etc. Not that I see it implemented much in these descriptions, but just that the understanding of it is preferred.
